The Cathedral and the Bazaar was given by Eric S. Raymond. 
The Cathedral model, in which source code is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of software developers. 
GNU Emacs and GCC were presented as examples. 
The Bazaar model, in which the code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. 
Raymond credits Linus Torvalds, leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. 
Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the Fetchmail project.
